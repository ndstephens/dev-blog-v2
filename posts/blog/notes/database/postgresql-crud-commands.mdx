Here are the primary SQL commands used for interacting with PostgreSQL.

In case you aren't aware, CRUD stands for "Create", "Read", "Update", and "Delete".

## Insert

```sql
INSERT INTO ingredients (
 title, image, type
) VALUES (
  'red pepper', 'red_pepper.jpg', 'vegetable'
);
```

<blockquote className="attention">
  **NOTE:** values that are strings must be in _single quotes_ (`''`).

Identifiers (table and column names) can be in double quotes, though it's not necessary.

Also, the order of the fields (column names) and their respective values must match.

</blockquote>

Your response should be:

```sql
INSERT 0 1
```

The `0` is no longer really in use in PostgreSQL (it's still there for backwards compatibility).

The `1` represents the insert (the number of records affected).

  can be.

### Multiple records

You can also insert multiple records in a single command:

```sql {8,11}
INSERT INTO ingredients (
  title, image, type
) VALUES
  ( 'avocado', 'avocado.jpg', 'fruit' ),
  ( 'banana', 'banana.jpg', 'fruit' ),
  ( 'beef', 'beef.jpg', 'meat' ),
  ( 'black_pepper', 'black_pepper.jpg', 'other' ),
  ( 'broccoli', 'broccoli.jpg', 'vegetable' ),
  -- etc etc
  ( 'watermelon', 'watermelon.jpg', 'fruit' )
ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;
```

Note the `ON CONFLICT` statement. This is telling PostgreSQL that if a row exists already (such as `broccoli`) to just do nothing about it.

## Upsert

With "upserting" the intention is to _insert_ the record if it does not already exist (based on `title` in this case)...but if it does exist then _update_ it.

```sql {5} /won''t/
INSERT INTO ingredients (
  title, image, type
) VALUES
  ( 'watermelon', 'banana.jpg', 'this won''t be updated' )
ON CONFLICT (title) DO UPDATE SET image = excluded.image;
```

In this example we're updating only the `image` value if `'watermelon'` already exists.

<blockquote className="attention">
  Also note that if you need to escape a single quote (`'`) in a value you use
  another single quote directly before it.
</blockquote>

## Update

```sql
UPDATE ingredients
SET image = 'strawberry.jpg'
WHERE title = 'watermelon';
```

The result would be:

| id  | title      | image          | type  |
| --- | ---------- | -------------- | ----- |
| 32  | watermelon | strawberry.jpg | fruit |

Without the `WHERE` clause then _all_ records in the table would have their `image` field updated.

</blockquote>

### Multiple records

```sql
UPDATE ingredients
SET type = 'staple'
WHERE type = 'other'
RETURNING *;
```

Here we're updating records with a `type` equal to `'other'` and changing those `type` values to `'staple'`...and returning all results (see next section).

## Returning results

This works for all commands, not just updates.

```sql
UPDATE ingredients
SET image = 'watermelon.jpg'
WHERE title = 'watermelon'
RETURNING title, image, id, type; -- can also use * to return everything
```

## Delete

```sql
DELETE FROM ingredients
WHERE type = 'staple'
RETURNING *;
```

| id  | title        | image            | type   |
| --- | ------------ | ---------------- | ------ |
| 6   | black_pepper | black_pepper.jpg | staple |
| 17  | flour        | flour.jpg        | staple |
| 18  | ginger       | ginger.jpg       | staple |
| 27  | salt         | salt.jpg         | staple |
| 30  | sugar        | sugar.jpg        | staple |

Here we have no `SET` clause.

Anything that matches the `WHERE` clause will be deleted.

`RETURNING`, like in updates, is optional if you want to see what was deleted.

## Select

```sql
SELECT * FROM ingredients;
```

The `*` represents all available columns. Usually we do not want to select everything.

```sql
SELECT id, title FROM ingredients;
```

Selecting only what you actually need results in smaller payloads and also, more importantly, shows specific intent within your code.

### Limit

```sql
SELECT id, title, image
FROM ingredients
LIMIT 5;
```

This will limit your return to only five records, the first five it finds.

### Offset

What if you want the next five records?

```sql
SELECT id, title, image
FROM ingredients
LIMIT 5
OFFSET 5;
```

This can be inefficient at large scales and without the use of _indexes_.

It also has the problem of if you're paging through data and someone inserts (or deletes) a record in the meantime it could shift your results.

### Add fields

In addition to selecting from the available columns on each record, you can add additional fields in your response.

```sql
SELECT *, COUNT(*) OVER ()::INTEGER AS total_count
FROM ingredients
LIMIT 5;
```

This will add a field labeled as `total_count` with a value being the total number of records in the table to each record in your response.

| id  | title        | image            | type  | total_count |
| --- | ------------ | ---------------- | ----- | ----------- |
| 1   | avocado      | avocado.jpg      | fruit | 30          |
| 2   | banana       | banana.jpg       | fruit | 30          |
| 3   | beef         | beef.jpg         | meat  | 30          |
| 4   | black_pepper | black_pepper.jpg | other | 30          |
| 5   | blueberry    | blueberry.jpg    | fruit | 30          |

## Filtering

### Where

Sometimes you don't want all of the records but are looking for one or more _specific_ records (based on filters).

In that case you can add a `WHERE` clause to filter your results down to a subset of all of your records.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM ingredients
WHERE type = 'fruit';
```

#### Not

Use `<>` to select records that are _not equal_ to a certain value:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM ingredients
WHERE type <> 'fruit';
```

### And

What if we wanted to only select ingredients that are vegetables _AND_ have IDs that are less than 20?

```sql
SELECT *
FROM ingredients
WHERE type = 'vegetable'
  AND id < 20;
```

### Or

You get the idea...

```sql
SELECT *
FROM ingredients
WHERE id <= 10
  OR id >= 20;
```

### Order By

#### ASC

Let's say you wanted to order your results not by `id` or insertion order but by `title`:

```sql /title/
SELECT * FROM ingredients
ORDER BY title;
```

This will alphabetize your returned list (in ascending `ASC` order by default).

#### DESC

The following will start by the largest `id` number and count backwards:

```sql /DESC/
SELECT * FROM ingredients
ORDER BY id DESC;
```
