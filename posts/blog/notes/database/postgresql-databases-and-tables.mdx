title: PostgreSQL Databases and Tables
description: Here is a quick guide on how to run PostgreSQL in Docker. It further explains how to create a database, tables, and records, as well as how to drop and alter tables. It also provides examples of psql commands and explains how to use them.

## Run PostgreSQL in Docker

```bash
# first, pull down a postgres docker image
docker pull postgres:<version>

# then run it in a container
docker run -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<password> --name=pg --rm -d -p 5432:5432 postgres:<version>
```

This will run a container with PostgreSQL in the background.

- Give it a password.
- Give it a name so you can refer to it with that shorthand later...here I'm using `pg`
- Use the `--rm` flag so the container deletes itself afterwards (rather than leave its logs and such around).
- Run it in the background with `-d`.
- The `-p` allows you to expose port `5432` locally which is the port Postgres runs on by default.
- Finally, include the name of the image you pulled.

You can run `docker ps` to see it running. You can also see it in the _Docker Desktop_ app running under the containers tab.

Run `docker kill <name>` to kill the container.

## `psql`

### Connect with `psql`

Connect to the running container with `psql`, the CLI tool for connecting to Postgres.

```bash
docker exec -u postgres -it pg psql
```

- `exec` is a Docker command used to run a command in a running container ðŸ¤¯.
- `-u postgres` to connect as the user `postgres` (aka "owner").
- `-it` to make the connection _"interactive"_.
- `pg` is the name of the container we want to run a command on.
- `psql` is the command we want to run in the `pg` container.

### `psql` commands

- `\?` help list.
- `\l` list all the databases.
- `\c <database-name>` to connect to a specific database.
- `\d` list all tables in currently connected database.
- `\d <table-name>` to view details (columns) of the table

## Databases

### Default databases

`template1` is what Postgres uses by default when you create a database. If you want your databases to have a default shape, you can modify `template1` to suit that.

`template0` should never be modified. If your `template1` gets out of whack, you can drop it and recreate from the fresh `template0`.

`postgres` exists for the purpose of a default database to connect to. We're actually connected to it by default since we didn't specify a database to connect to. You can technically could delete it but there's no reason to and a lot of tools and extensions do rely on it being there.

### Create a database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE recipedb;
```

<blockquote className="attention">
  SQL commands must end with a semicolon (`;`) in `psql`
</blockquote>

#### Connect to the db

```bash
postgres=# \c recipedb;
# prompt changes to...
recipedb=#
```

## Tables

### Create a table

```sql
CREATE TABLE ingredients (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
  title VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);
```

<blockquote className="attention">
  SQL commands can stretch over multiple lines (mind your commas where
  necessary)
</blockquote>

#### List the tables

```bash
recipedb=# \d
```

| Schema | Name               | Type     | Owner    |
| ------ | ------------------ | -------- | -------- |
| public | ingredients        | table    | postgres |
| public | ingredients_id_seq | sequence | postgres |

The `sequence` type stores the _id counter_.

#### View the table schema

```bash
recipedb=# \d ingredients
```

| Column | Type                   | Collation | Nullable | Default                      |
| ------ | ---------------------- | --------- | -------- | ---------------------------- |
| id     | integer                |           | not null | generated always as identity |
| title  | character varying(255) |           | not null |

### Add a record to the table

```sql
INSERT INTO ingredients (title) VALUES ('bell pepper');
```

The `id` field gets created automatically since we created it using the property `GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY`.

#### View the record

```sql
SELECT * FROM ingredients;
```

| id  | title       |
| --- | ----------- |
| 1   | bell pepper |

### Drop a table

```sql
DROP TABLE ingredients;
```

Like `rm` in bash, it's not one you can recover from. Once a table is dropped, it is dropped.

### Alter a table

#### Add columns

```sql
ALTER TABLE ingredients ADD COLUMN image VARCHAR(255);
```

```sql
ALTER TABLE ingredients
ADD COLUMN image VARCHAR ( 255 ),
ADD COLUMN type VARCHAR ( 50 ) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'vegetable';
```

<blockquote className="attention">
It's best to do multiple related operations in a single command/query.

If it's going to fail you want the whole thing to fail, not some to succeed and others to possibly fail. That way you can try it again.

This is called "transactional". It's the best approach for maintaining data integrity.

</blockquote>

It's also worth noting the final operation in the command.

Since we're saying the field must have a value (`NOT NULL`), and assuming this table already has records in it, then we'd need to provide it with a default value. (That value could be an empty string).

If our table is still empty then we would not need to provide a default value.

#### Drop columns

```sql
ALTER TABLE ingredients DROP COLUMN image;
```

## Data types

You can view the long list of [data types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html) that PostgreSQL offers.

More can be added using plugins.
