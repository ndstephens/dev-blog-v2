If you're going to have have two tables reference each other, use **foreign keys** where possible.

It forces useful constraints to make sure _delete_ and _update_ behaviors are intentional and it makes the queries faster.

Let's assume you have two tables in your database.

**RECIPES** table

```sql
CREATE TABLE recipes (
  recipe_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
  title VARCHAR ( 255 ) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  body TEXT
);
```

| Column    | Type                   | Collation | Nullable | Default                      |
| --------- | ---------------------- | --------- | -------- | ---------------------------- |
| recipe_id | integer                |           | not null | generated always as identity |
| title     | character varying(255) |           | not null |
| body      | text                   |           |          |

```console
Indexes:
    "recipes_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (recipe_id)
    "recipes_title_key" UNIQUE CONSTRAINT, btree (title)
```

<br />

**RECIPES PHOTOS** table

```sql {4}
CREATE TABLE recipes_photos (
  photo_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
  url VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  recipe_id INTEGER REFERENCES recipes(recipe_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

| Column    | Type                   | Collation | Nullable | Default                      |
| --------- | ---------------------- | --------- | -------- | ---------------------------- |
| photo_id  | integer                |           | not null | generated always as identity |
| url       | character varying(255) |           | not null |
| recipe_id | integer                |           |          |

```console {3-4}
Indexes:
    "recipes_photos_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (photo_id)
Foreign-key constraints:
    "recipes_photos_recipe_id_fkey" FOREIGN KEY (recipe_id) REFERENCES recipes(recipe_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
```

<br />

- The `REFERENCES` portion means it's going to be a **foreign key**. You tell it what it's going to match up to. `recipes` is the table and `recipe_id` is the name of the column it'll match. In our case those are the same name, but it doesn't have to be. It must be the _primary key_ of the other table.
- Then you need to tell it what to do when you delete something. With `ON DELETE CASCADE` you say "if the row in the other table gets deleted, delete this one too." So if we delete something from recipes, it will automatically delete all its photos.
- You can also do `ON DELETE SET NULL` which does exactly what it says it does. In this example that would mean setting `recipe_id` in the corresponding photo records to `null`.
- There's also `ON DELETE NO ACTION` which will error out if you try to delete something from recipes if there are still photos left. This forces developers to clean up photos before deleting recipes.
- Use `ON UPDATE` if you need to handle some synced state between the two tables.

The foreign key constraint also prevents you from adding orphan photos. If you try to add a photo record with a `recipe_id` that does not match a record in the `recipe` table you will get a warning.

In the example above you can technically add a photo record without any `recipe_id` and that would work. Perhaps you want to add a photo and give it a foreign key later. However that could result in an orphan photo. It's best to also set `recipe_id` to `NOT NULL` so that you're required to provide a value...and as previously stated, that value must match an existing record in the `recipe` table.

<blockquote className="attention">
**NOTE:** this example represents a **one-to-many** relationship.

- Each recipe has _many_ photos.
- Each photo belongs to _one_ recipe.
