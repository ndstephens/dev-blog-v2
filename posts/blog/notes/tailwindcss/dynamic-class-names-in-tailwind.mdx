Here's a quick one that will hopefully help someone prevent or fix a self-imposed bug in their code.

Creating a dynamic class name the **wrong way** (see below) feels like a very intuitive approach for many developers.

I personally made this mistake and it took me a while to realize what the problem was...and I had previously read through the docs ðŸ¤“. The info is [there](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/content-configuration#dynamic-class-names), I just happened to forget about it.

Tailwind will only find classes that exist as _complete unbroken strings_ in your source files.

## Don't Do

If you use string interpolation or concatenate partial class names together, Tailwind _will not find them_ and therefore will not generate the corresponding CSS:

```html
<div class="text-{{ error ? 'red' : 'green' }}-600"></div>
```

## Do Do

Instead, make sure any class names you're using exist in full:

```html
<div class="{{ error ? 'text-red-600' : 'text-green-600' }}"></div>
```
