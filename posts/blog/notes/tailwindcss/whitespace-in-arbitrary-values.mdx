When an arbitrary value needs to contain a space, use an **underscore** (`_`) instead and Tailwind will automatically convert it to a space at build-time:

```html /1fr_500px_2fr/
<div class="grid grid-cols-[1fr_500px_2fr]">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

In situations where underscores are common but spaces are invalid, Tailwind will _preserve the underscore_ instead of converting it to a space, for example in URLs:

```html /what_a_rush/
<div class="bg-[url('/what_a_rush.png')]">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

In the rare case that you actually _need to use an underscore_ but it's ambiguous because a space is valid as well, _escape the underscore with a backslash_ (`\`) and Tailwind won't convert it to a space:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```html /hello\\_world/
<div class="before:content-['hello\_world']">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

If you're using something like **JSX** where the backslash is stripped from the rendered HTML, use [String.raw()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/raw) so the backslash isn't treated as a JavaScript escape character:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```jsx
<div className={String.raw`before:content-['hello\_world']`}>
  {/* ... */}
</div>
```
