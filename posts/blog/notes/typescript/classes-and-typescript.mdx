title: Classes and TypeScript
description: For classes, the TypeScript programming language provides three access modifier keywords to describe who should be able to see and use class fields and methods. The keywords are `public`, `protected`, and `private`. Public allows access to instances of the class and subclasses, protected allows access only within the class and subclasses, and private only allows access within the class itself. Additionally, the `readonly` keyword can be used to prevent reassignment of a property and the param properties provide a more concise syntax for class definition.

## Access modifier keywords

TypeScript provides three **access modifier keywords** which can be used with class fields and methods to describe who should be able to see and use them.

| KEYWORD:  | WHO CAN ACCESS:                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| public    | instances of the class and subclasses |
|           | code within the class itself          |
|           | code within subclasses                |
| protected | code within the class itself          |
|           | code within subclasses                |
| private   | code within the class itself          |

A few things to note:

- A class can expose `private` functionality **to a subclass** by including it in `protected` functionality
- A class and subclass can expose `private` and `protected` functionality by including it in `public` functionality.
- Can think of this almost like `getters` and `setters` where a particular field or method may not be directly accessible, but its value is made accessible through another bit of functionality.

<blockquote className="attention">

**NOTE:** access modifier keywords do **NOT** provide any real privacy or security benefits at runtime. These are purely development and compile time tools.

These are about `encapsulation`, not security.

## `readonly`

Can be used with access modifier keywords.

Think of it like `const` in that it prevents reassignment, but not mutability.

However remember that _primitives are immutable_, so trying to update the value of a number (for instance) is not allowed.

```ts /readonly/
class Car {
  public make: string;
  public model: string;
  public readonly year: number;

  constructor(make: string, model: string, year: number) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
  }

  updateYear() {
    this.year++; // <- ERROR
    // Error: Cannot assign to 'year' because it is a read-only property.
  }
}
```

## Param Properties

TypeScript provides a more concise syntax when defining classes through the use of **param properties**

**BEFORE:**

```ts
class Car {
  make: string;
  model: string;
  year: number;
  constructor(make: string, model: string, year: number) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
  }
}
```

**AFTER:**

```ts /public/
class Car {
  constructor(public make: string, public model: string, public year: number) {}
}
```

They compile exactly the same.
