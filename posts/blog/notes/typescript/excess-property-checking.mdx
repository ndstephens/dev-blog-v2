title: Excess Property Checking
description: TypeScript helps detect an issue in the use of object literals by checking for excess properties in comparison to a defined type. If an object literal is used as an input to a function, TypeScript throws an error if there are any excess properties. The error can be fixed by either removing the property, adding the property to the function argument type or passing the object as a variable.

TypeScript helps us catch a particular type of problem around the use of **object literals**.

<blockquote className="attention">
  **NOTE:** this relates to using a defined **type** versus an **object
  literal**
</blockquote>

```ts {15}
function printCar(car: {
  make: string;
  model: string;
  year: number;
  chargeVoltage?: number;
}) {
  // ...
}

printCar({
  make: 'Tesla',
  model: 'Model 3',
  year: 2020,
  chargeVoltage: 220,
  color: 'RED', // <- ERROR: Excess Property Error
});
```

<blockquote className="warning">
**Error msg:** "... Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'color' does not exist in type `{ make: string; model: string; year: number; chargeVoltage?: number | undefined; }`"
</blockquote>

The possible fixes are:

1. Remove the `color` property from the object
2. Add a `color: string` to the function argument type (can also be optional)
3. Create a variable to hold this value, and then pass the variable into the `printCar` function

Here's the fix using option 3:

```ts {9}
const myTesla = {
  make: 'Tesla',
  model: 'Model 3',
  year: 2020,
  chargeVoltage: 220,
  color: 'RED',
};

printCar(myTesla); // NO ERROR
```

The function body has no possible way to access the `color` property.

If an **object literal** is used as the function's input then that object exists only as that input's value and no where else in the code.

If the function can't access the `color` property then there's no reason for that property to exist on the object literal.

However if the input's value comes from a **variable**, that variable (and its `color` property) **might** be used elsewhere in the code.

Therefore the function doesn't care if it includes extra properties...as long as it includes the properties (and types) it's requiring.
