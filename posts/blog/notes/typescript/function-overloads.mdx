title: Function Overloads
description: Function Overloads are a solution in TypeScript for resolving similar issues as Discriminated Unions. The idea is to have the type of one parameter determine the type of another parameter in a function. This is done by declaring multiple "heads" that define an argument list and return type, followed by the implementation. The implementation must be general enough to include all the possibilities from the "heads".

We want the _type of one value_ to identify what the _type of another value_ will be (there needs to be a _linkage_).

Often this involves multiple params or values that are **union types**, but TypeScript can't identify the linkage unless we're _explicit_ about it.

In the case of **Discriminated Unions**, if we knew the type of one value then TypeScript would be able to infer another value's type (from its union type).

Here we're talking about a function's _parameter types_. If we know the type of one parameter, we want TS to infer the type of the other parameter(s).

The problem:

```ts
type FormSubmitHandler = (data: FormData) => void;
type MessageHandler = (evt: MessageEvent) => void;

function handleMainEvent(
  elem: HTMLFormElement | HTMLIFrameElement,
  handler: FormSubmitHandler | MessageHandler
) {}

const myFrame = document.getElementsByTagName('iframe')[0];
// const myFrame: HTMLIFrameElement

handleMainEvent(myFrame, (val) => {});
// (parameter) val: any
```

Even though `myFrame`'s type sets `handleMainEvent`'s param `elem` to `HTMLIFrameElement`, TypeScript has no way of knowing we therefore want the `handler` param to be of type `MessageHandler`.

<blockquote className="attention">
  We need to create a _linkage_ between the first and second arguments, which
  allows our callback's argument type to change based on the type of
  `handleMainEvent`'s first argument.
</blockquote>

We solve this using **Function Overloads**:

```ts
type FormSubmitHandler = (data: FormData) => void;
type MessageHandler = (evt: MessageEvent) => void;

function handleMainEvent(elem: HTMLFormElement, handler: FormSubmitHandler);
function handleMainEvent(elem: HTMLIFrameElement, handler: MessageHandler);
function handleMainEvent(
  elem: HTMLFormElement | HTMLIFrameElement,
  handler: FormSubmitHandler | MessageHandler
) {}

const myFrame = document.getElementsByTagName('iframe')[0];
// const myFrame: HTMLIFrameElement

const myForm = document.getElementsByTagName('form')[0];
// const myForm: HTMLFormElement

handleMainEvent(myFrame, (val) => {});
// function handleMainEvent(elem: HTMLIFrameElement, handler: MessageHandler): any (+1 overload)

handleMainEvent(myForm, (val) => {});
// function handleMainEvent(elem: HTMLFormElement, handler: FormSubmitHandler): any (+1 overload)
```

This looks like three function declarations, but it's really two _“heads”_ that define an _argument list_ and a _return type_, followed by our original implementation.

If you take a close look at tooltips and autocomplete feedback you get from the TypeScript language server, it's clear that you are only able to call into the two _“heads”_, leaving the underlying _“third head + implementation”_ inaccessible from the outside world.

<blockquote className="attention">
  One last thing that's important to note: **the “implementation” function
  signature must be general enough to include everything that's possible through
  the exposed first and second function heads.**
