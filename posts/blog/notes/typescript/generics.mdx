title: Generics
description: Generics are a way of defining types in terms of other types in TypeScript. They are type parameters and are used to establish a relationship between the type of thing being passed to a function and the type of thing returned from the function. Generics are similar to function arguments, but for types, and their type will change based on the type parameters provided.

Generics are **type parameters**.

They are a way of defining types that are expressed _in terms of other types_.

<blockquote className="info">
  Often they're used as a mechanism of defining a relationship between the type
  of thing we **pass to a function**, and the type of thing **returned from that
  function**. But they aren't limited to only being used with functions.
</blockquote>

## Defining a type parameter

Type parameters can be thought of as _"function arguments, but for types"_.

Just like how functions will return different values depending on the arguments you pass them, **Generics will change their type depending on the type parameters you supply to them**.

```ts
function listToDict<T>(
  list: T[],
  idGen: (arg: T) => string
): { [k: string]: T } {
  const dict: { [k: string]: T } = {};

  list.forEach((element) => {
    const dictKey = idGen(element);
    dict[dictKey] = element;
  });

  return dict;
}
```

<blockquote className="attention">
  **NOTE:** we get a different kind of dictionary returned out of `listToDict`
  **depending on the type of the array we pass in**.
</blockquote>

### The TypeParam, and its usage to provide an argument type

**`<T>` to the right of `listDict`**

- means that the type of this function is now parameterized in terms of a type parameter `T`
- which may change on a per-usage basis

**`list: T[]` as a first argument**

- means we accept a list of `T`â€˜s.

**`idGen: (arg: T) => string`**

- means this function better be setup to take as an input whatever type `T` is (whatever `list` is an array of) b/c that's the type that `arg` will be
- we will get type-checking alignment between the `list` array and the `idGen` function
- we will get the benefits of type-checking within the `idGen` function

<blockquote className="attention">

**Again...** TypeScript will infer what `T` is, on a per-usage basis, depending on what kind of array we pass in.

If we use a `string[]`, `T` will be `string`.

If we use a `number[]`, `T` will be `number`.

</blockquote>

#### Simpler example:

```ts
function wrapInArray<T>(arg: T): [T] {
  return [arg];
}
// function wrapInArray<T>(arg: T): [T]
```

In use:

```ts
wrapInArray(3);
// function wrapInArray<number>(arg: number): [number]

wrapInArray(new Date());
// function wrapInArray<Date>(arg: Date): [Date]

wrapInArray(new RegExp('/s/'));
// function wrapInArray<RegExp>(arg: RegExp): [RegExp]
```

## Generics Best Practices

- The point of Generics and Type Parameters is to relate multiple things.
- Use each type parameter _at least twice_.
