title: Mapped Index Types
description: TypeScript allows you to define new types based on existing ones using Mapped Types and Indexed Access Types. The mapped type creates a new type by looping over a set of keys and determining the value type for each key based on the original type. The built-in `Pick` type utility allows you to select a set of properties from an original type and use them to create a new type. Additionally, TypeScript provides three utility types `Partial`, `Required`, and `Readonly` to modify properties in a type as optional, required, or readonly respectively. You can also define your own utility types for specific use cases.

## Filtering Properties by **key**

**Mapped types** work great with **indexed access types**, because the index is used when defining the value type.

```ts
type PartOfWindow = {
  [Key in 'document' | 'navigator' | 'setTimeout']: Window[Key];
};

// type PartOfWindow = {
//   document: Document;
//   navigator: Navigator;
//   setTimeout: (
//     handler: TimerHandler,
//     timeout?: number | undefined,
//     ...arguments: any[]
//   ) => number;
// };
```

The mapped type "loops over" all of the possible keys and determines the appropriate value type for each key.

## Use with Type Parameters (Generics)

Rework the example above using **type parameters**.

Let the caller define which keys they'd like to use.

We'll call this type `PickWindowProperties` because you get to specify which properties from `Window` you'd like:

```ts
type PickWindowProperties<Keys extends keyof Window> = {
  [Key in Keys]: Window[Key];
};

type PartOfWindow = PickWindowProperties<
  'document' | 'navigator' | 'setTimeout'
>;
// type PartOfWindow = {
//   document: Document;
//   navigator: Navigator;
//   setTimeout: (
//     handler: TimerHandler,
//     timeout?: number | undefined,
//     ...arguments: any[]
//   ) => number;
// };
```

`<Keys extends keyof Window>` limits the options of what `Keys` can be...it can only be a **union of literal types** (strings) that are keys on the `Window` interface.

Also take note of `[Key in Keys]`. That's the **mapped type** that "loops" over `Keys` and each time provides that `Key` as an **indexed access type** to `Window`.

Those loops of `Window[Key]` with the different `Key` values provides the specific value types for `PartOfWindow`.

### Make it Fully Generalized

Let's generalize it one step further by allowing this type to work on _anything_, not just `Window`.

Because this is no longer a type that _exclusively_ works with `Window`, we'll rename this type to `PickProperties`.

```ts
// Completely Generic
type PickProperties<Keys extends keyof ValueType, ValueType> = {
  [Key in Keys]: ValueType[Key];
};

// Used with `Window`
type PartOfWindow = PickProperties<
  'document' | 'navigator' | 'setTimeout',
  Window
>;
// type PartOfWindow = {
//   readonly document: Document;
//   readonly navigator: Navigator;
//   setTimeout: (
//     handler: TimerHandler,
//     timeout?: number | undefined,
//     ...arguments: any[]
//   ) => number;
// };
```

## Pick - TS utility type

The `PickProperties` mapped typed created above matches the built-in TS utility type `Pick` exactly:

```ts
/**
 * From T, pick a set of properties whose keys are in the union K
 */
type Pick<K extends keyof T, T> = {
  [P in K]: T[P];
};
```

## Mapping Modifiers - More TS Utility Types

There are a couple of final things we can do to the properties as we create each type: set whether the value placed there should be `readonly` and/or `optional`.

This is fairly straightforward, and you can see the use of the `?` and `readonly` in the three other built-in TypeScript utility types below.

If there's a `-` to the left of `readonly` or `?` in a mapped type, that indicates **removal** of this modifier instead of application of the modifier.

```ts
/**
 * Make all properties in T optional
 */
type Partial<T> = {
  [P in keyof T]?: T[P];
};

/**
 * Make all properties in T required
 */
type Required<T> = {
  [P in keyof T]-?: T[P];
};

/**
 * Make all properties in T readonly
 */
type Readonly<T> = {
  readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P];
};
```

There is no built-in TypeScript utility type for `readonly` removal, but you could implement one if you needed to (not necessarily a good idea though)

```ts
type NotReadonly<T> = {
  -readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P];
};
```
