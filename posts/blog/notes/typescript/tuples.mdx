title: Tuples
description: A tuple in TypeScript is a data structure that consists of an ordered list of elements with a specific type. To declare a tuple, you need to explicitly state the type of each element in the list. As of TypeScript 4.3, the support for enforcing tuple length constraints is limited.

TypeScript, by its nature, will try to infer types as specifically as possible without getting in our way.

It will always assume a list to be an **array**.

We need to explicitly state the type of a **tuple** whenever we declare one.

```ts
let myCar = [2002, 'Toyota', 'Corolla'];

// let myCar: (string | number)[]
```

To make it a **tuple**:

```ts
let myCar: [number, string, string] = [2002, 'Toyota', 'Corolla'];

// let myCar: [number, string, string]
```

## Limitations

<blockquote className="attention">
  As of `TypeScript 4.3` there's limited support for enforcing tuple length
  constraints.
</blockquote>

For example, you get the support you'd hope for on assignment:

```ts
const numPair: [number, number] = [4, 5, 6]; // <- ERROR
```

<blockquote className="warning">
  **Error msg:** Type '[number, number, number]' is not assignable to type
  '[number, number]'. Source has 3 element(s) but target allows only 2.
</blockquote>

But you don't get support around `push` and `pop`:

```ts
const numPair: [number, number] = [4, 5];
numPair.push(6); // [4, 5, 6]
numPair.pop(); // [4, 5]
numPair.pop(); // [4]
numPair.pop(); // []
```
