title: Type Inference and Literal Types
description: The basics of TypeScript's handling of type inference and literal types. Using "let" infers a general type, while "const" infers a specific, immutable literal type. Objects properties are non-literal by default, but can be made literal with "as const".

In TypeScript, variables are "born" with their types.

```ts {4,9}
// when using "let", TS will infer a more general type
// allows for value reassignment
let age = 6;
// let age: number

// when using "const", TS will infer a more specific type
// can NOT be reassigned and "number" is an immutable value type
const age = 6;
// const age: 6  <- literal type
```

The type `6` is called a **literal type**. It's not just any `number` type, it's a `number` that's also a `6`.

<blockquote className="attention">
  Inference is not so specific as to get in the way of common behavior.
</blockquote>

For example, the `let` variable declaration above could have assumed `age` to be of type `6`, but this would have interfered with our ability to set this re-assignable variable to `7` or `8`.

## Objects

This is why object properties will be non-literal types when inferred...b/c object properties are mutable.

If you want them to be **literal types**, then finish with `as const`:

```ts {13}
const obj = {
  name: 'Joe',
  age: 30,
};
// const obj: {
//   name: string;
//   age: number;
// }

const obj = {
  name: 'Joe',
  age: 30,
} as const;
// const obj: {
//   readonly name: "Joe";
//   readonly age: 30;
// }
```
