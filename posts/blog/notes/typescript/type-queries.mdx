title: Type Queries
description: The keywords `keyof` and `typeof` are type queries in TypeScript that allow you to obtain type information from values. `keyof` is used to obtain types representing all property keys on a given interface. `typeof` is used to extract a type from a value. When used with classes, `typeof` is commonly used to obtain a type representing the constructor (or static side) of a class.

Type queries allow us to obtain **type information** from **values**.

## `keyof`

The `keyof` type query allows you to obtain types representing all property keys on a given interface.

This results in a **union type**.

```ts
type ObjectLiteralType = {
  first: 1;
  second: 2;
};

type Result = keyof ObjectLiteralType;
// Inferred Type: "first" | "second"
```

### Narrow with an intersection operator

```ts
type DatePropertyNames = keyof Date;
```

Not all keys on `Date` are `string`'s. One is a `symbol`.

We can separate out the different _key types_ using the **intersection operator** (`&`).

- "I only want to see the keys that are of type `string`", or...
- "I only want to see the keys that are of type `symbol`"

With the intersection operator we're left with only the sub-part of the `keyof Date` keys that are also included by `string` or `symbol`.

```ts
type DatePropertyNames = keyof Date;

type DateStringPropertyNames = DatePropertyNames & string;
// type DateStringPropertyNames = "toString" | "toDateString" | ...

type DateSymbolPropertyNames = DatePropertyNames & symbol;
// type DateSymbolPropertyNames = typeof Symbol.toPrimitive
```

  **NOTE:** this is similar to using the `Extract` TS utility

## `typeof`

The `typeof` type query allows you to extract a _type_ from a _value_.

```ts
async function main() {
  const apiResponse = await Promise.all([
    fetch('https://example.com'),
    Promise.resolve('Titanium White'),
  ]);

  type ApiResponseType = typeof apiResponse;
  // type ApiResponseType = [Response, string];
}
```

### with Classes

**Classes are values and types, at the same time.**

A common use of `typeof` is to obtain a type representing the **static side** of a class (meaning: `constructor`, static properties, and other things not present on an _instance_ of the class).

```ts
class Fruit {
  constructor(
    public readonly name: string,
    public readonly mass: number,
    public readonly color: string
  ) {}

  static createBanana() {
    return new Fruit('banana', 108, 'yellow');
  }
}

const MyFruit = Fruit;
// const MyFruit: typeof Fruit;

const banana = Fruit.createBanana();
// const banana: Fruit;

const apple = new Fruit('apple', 98, 'red');
// const apple: Fruit;
```

- `MyFruit`, the _class_ (constructor), is of type `typeof Fruit`
- _Instances_ are of type `Fruit`
