title: Type Systems
description: Type checking is a task that evaluates compatibility or type equivalence between a function's input and a provided argument. It also applies to variable assignments and return types. TypeScript uses a structural type system, meaning that it only cares about the shape or structure of the argument, not its origin. TypeScript is also a static type system, meaning it performs type checking at compile time, while dynamic type systems perform type checking at runtime.

## What is type checking?

Type-checking can be thought of as a task that attempts to evaluate the question of **compatibility** or **type equivalence**.

<blockquote className="attention">

**NOTE:** **Compatibility** and **Type Equivalence** are not necessarily the same as **Exact Equality**.

This is important to remember.

</blockquote>

```ts
function foo(param) {
  // ...
}

foo(myArg);

// TYPE CHECKING
// -------------
// Is `myArg` type-equivalent to what `foo` whats to receive?
```

The same question is asked in regards to variable assignment and when checking return types.

## Nominal vs Structural

### Nominal

Nominal type systems are all about **NAMES**.

- Type checking is done primarily with names.
  - All that matters is whether `myCar` is an instance of the `class` **named** `Car`.
- This is the type system of most statically typed languages.

### Structural

Structural type systems are all about **STRUCTURE** or **SHAPE**.

- For example, a function doesn't care about which class constructor its argument came from, it only cares about whether the argument passed to it meets its parameter's requirements.
- **This is the type system TypeScript uses.**

```ts
class Car {
  make: string;
  model: string;
  year: number;
  isElectric: boolean;
}

class Truck {
  make: string;
  model: string;
  year: number;
  towingCapacity: number;
}

const vehicle = {
  make: 'Honda',
  model: 'Accord',
  year: 2017,
};

function printCar(car: { make: string; model: string; year: number }) {
  console.log(`${car.make} ${car.model} (${car.year})`);
}

printCar(new Car()); // Fine
printCar(new Truck()); // Fine
printCar(vehicle); // Fine
```

## Other type systems

### Static vs Dynamic

- Static type systems perform type-checking at **compile time**.
  - TypeScript is a static type system.
- Dynamic type systems perform type-checking at **runtime**.

### Duck typing

- _“If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quack like a duck, then it probably is a duck”._
- In practice, this is very similar to structural typing, but “Duck typing” is usually used to describe dynamic type systems.

### "Strong" vs "Weak"

- These terms, while used frequently, have no agreed-upon technical definition.
- In the context of TypeScript it's common for those who say **“strong”** to really mean **“static”**.
