Here's an example of using the CSS `:has()` pseudo-class to conditionally apply styles based on a minimum length of its total number of children elements.

```css
ul:has(li:nth-child(6)) {
  columns: 2;
}
```

If there are at least 6 `<li>` children elements then apply `columns: 2;` to the `<ul>`.

You can then follow that up with another conditional if there are even more children.

```css
ul:has(li:nth-child(11)) {
  columns: 3;
}
```

Just be sure to have the more specific condition (in this case `11`) lower down the cascade.
