```js
const copyText = (textToCopy) =>
  navigator.clipboard.writeText(textToCopy).then(
    () => {
      /* clipboard successfully set */
    },
    () => {
      /* clipboard write failed */
    }
  );
```

[Clipboard.writeText() documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard/writeText)

<blockquote className="attention">
The user has to interact with the page or a UI element in order for this feature to work (would need to call the `copyText` function in an event listener).

The `"clipboard-write"` permission of the `Permissions API` is granted automatically to pages when they are in the active tab.
