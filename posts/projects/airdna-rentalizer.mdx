## The Project

Rentalizer is an analytics tool that's used by realtors, property managers, and homeowners to estimate the earning potential of a property. To maximize its potential we realized it needed a facelift and a new feature set. We also wanted to create a separate iframe widget that could be used on other websites. The widget would be a funnel for new customers by promoting the app and giving them a taste of the data.

## Challenges

Some of the challenges we faced were:

- Give the UI/UX a facelift without disrupting customers who were familiar with the current design.
- A unified UI that works in both the app (with its wide feature set) and the more simplified widget.
- Simplify the API to work along with the limited data that the widget would have access to.
- Create responsive charts that can effectively display 2 years of data on multiple screen sizes.
- Begin this project with a new team that's still getting familiar with the codebase.

## Personal Growth

This was the first large project I worked on with all members of the new team. It also required a lot of coordination with the backend and design teams to accomplish our goals. First we had to decide whether to refactor the current codebase or do a substantial rewrite, eventually deciding on a rewrite. We also decided to deploy the new updates and features in stages as they were completed. This required a lot of architectural thought and planning between all teams involved. However it also needed adaptability to changes as they came up. In fact, getting customer feedback and iterating on the design became a big part of the process. It proved to be a great way to get the team involved and excited about the project.
