## Thanks for visiting my spot on the web

I started this site to share what I'm learning while I'm learning it. For years I have been saving [notes](/blog/notes) while taking a course or reading docs, collecting helpful and interesting [snippets](/blog/snippets) of code I find useful, and keeping track of [ideas and solutions](/blog/articles) that I myself come up with.

Considering how much I have benefitted from the content that other developers share I figured it was time to return the favor. Hopefully something on this site helps you in some way.

## So who am I?

Professionally I'm a software engineer that focuses on frontend web development. I say I'm self-taught, but as I mentioned above it is only possible because of all the amazing resources others have created and shared.

Some of my favorite tech and topics I write about are [React](https://beta.reactjs.org/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Recently I have started learning C++. The language is used a lot in the creation of audio plug-in software (synths and effects) and is also the language used for certain creative coding libraries such as [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/).

## Intro to programming

Prior to building with code I created things with wood, metal, plastics, cement, fiberglass, etc. I loved it, and still do, but it was a much more complicated life. Having a workshop is amazing, but it's a lot to manage and maintain. Also, moving it was a nightmare.

However it was working in that field that led me to programming.

I began incorporating "tech" into the work I was doing for both residential and commercial clients. Things began to take off when I worked with an event design company and started pairing simple motion sensors with prop lighting. You may have heard about or used [Arduinos](https://www.arduino.cc/index.htm). I know they've been at the threshold of other's introduction into programming.

While living in Portland, OR, I assisted in building the new boardroom furniture for the tech company [Puppet](https://www.puppet.com/). I spent a lot of time at their amazing office and loved the entire feel and vibe of the place. Everyone I met and engaged with was interesting and generous. It felt like an environment and culture I'd enjoy working in.

I eventually decided to nudge my life in that direction.

## Besides code

Besides coding I love being outside. It's good to get away from the desk and glowing monitor. Hiking and backpacking are a genuine passion, though I don't ever seem to dedicate enough time to either. I love going out for breakfast...maybe even more than dinner. I also started getting into gardening, though lately it's only been simple indoor experiments. I've become a master at growing sprouts ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

I appreciate you checking out my site. You can also visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/ndstephens) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ndstephens/) pages if interested. I'm not too active on social media, though, so you probably won't find me there.
